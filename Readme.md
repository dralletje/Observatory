# Observatory

A suite of tools and libraries to actually really test.


### TODO

**Documentation**
- [ ] Make a nice readme with good introduction
- [ ] Make some example setups and ways to use it
- [ ] Actually make a api reference
- [ ] Tweak every `package.json` with the necessary fields

**Telescope**
- [ ] Make telescope connect with jest for live result comparison
- [ ] Make a `bin` for telescope that will build CRA if necessary, and then run it. (possible `post-install`?)
